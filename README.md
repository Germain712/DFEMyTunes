1. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
    I am doing this project to show that I have some basic understanding of how to create/build a functional API.

2. HOW I EXPECTED THE CHALLENGE TO GO?

3. WHAT WENT WELL? WHAT DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED?

4. POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE REVISIONS OF THE PROJECT?

5. SCREENSHOTS SHOWING YOUR POSTMAN REQUESTS AND THE OUTPUT FROM THE API

6. SCREENSHOTS OF YOUR DATABASE TO PROVE THAT DATA IS BEING PERSISTED

7. SCREENSHOTS OF YOUR TEST RESULTS, INCLUDING COVERAGE REPORT
