1. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
    I am doing this project to show that I have some basic understanding of how to create/build a functional API.

2. HOW I EXPECTED THE CHALLENGE TO GO?
    I Expected the challenge to be hard, and it proved me right.
3. WHAT WENT WELL? WHAT DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED?

4. POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE REVISIONS OF THE PROJECT?
    Attending every single lesson and practising, these are the improvements I can make.


5. SCREENSHOTS SHOWING YOUR POSTMAN REQUESTS AND THE OUTPUT FROM THE API
    Wasn't successful with getting Postman requests. I missed the session when we learnt about how to use Postman due to having surgery and having to stay overnight.


6. SCREENSHOTS OF YOUR DATABASE TO PROVE THAT DATA IS BEING PERSISTED

7. SCREENSHOTS OF YOUR TEST RESULTS, INCLUDING COVERAGE REPORT
